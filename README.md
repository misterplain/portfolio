# Portfolio

A React App created to showcase various personal projects, using Material UI and Figma as design tools. 

The deployed site can be found [HERE](https://patrickobrien.onrender.com/)

Due to the usage limitations of Render and Cyclic, where I've hosted the Node.js backends for various projects, the backend code for this project can be found [HERE](https://github.com/misterplain/activeServer)

Any and all feedback on this project is welcome, you may contact me [HERE](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-o-brien-6743b044/)!
